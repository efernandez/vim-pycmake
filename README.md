Small vim plugin to help working in CMake C/C++ projects

After loading this plugin, vim will scan for a CMake project for any C/C++ source or header file opened. If such a project is found, the include paths generated by CMake will be added to the vim path, and to syntastic include path as well. This enables the use of go-to-file over `#include`s and filename completion, among other nice things.

On opening a c/c++ file, this plugin will also scan the headers for tags and store them under /tmp/tags. This is only done once per header, but it can significantly slow down the opening of a source file the first time.

More features to come.
